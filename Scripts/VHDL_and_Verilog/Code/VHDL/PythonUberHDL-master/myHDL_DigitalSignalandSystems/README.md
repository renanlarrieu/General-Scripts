# Digital Signals and Systems with myHDL
In this directory are a bunch of jupyter notebooks that serve as educational materials on how to utilize pythons [myHDL](http://www.myhdl.org/) in the development and testing of Digital Signal and System components. 

Some of the topics covered are:
* Synthesizers 
  * Saw Tooth waveform (https://github.com/PyLCARS/PythonUberHDL/blob/master/myHDL_DigitalSignalandSystems/Synthesizers/SawToothWaveGen.ipynb)
  
  * Chebyshev polynomial continues sine wave generator (https://github.com/PyLCARS/PythonUberHDL/blob/master/myHDL_DigitalSignalandSystems/Synthesizers/myHDL_SinewaveGenerator.ipynb)

* Digital Filters
  * CIC filter (https://github.com/PyLCARS/PythonUberHDL/blob/master/myHDL_DigitalSignalandSystems/Digital_Filters/CIC%20filter.ipynb)
  
  * IIR Direct Form II Transpose (https://github.com/PyLCARS/PythonUberHDL/blob/master/myHDL_DigitalSignalandSystems/Digital_Filters/IIR_Filter_DIIT.ipynb)
  
* Phase Lock Loop Componets

  * Phase Detectors and Fractional-N Dividers (https://github.com/PyLCARS/PythonUberHDL/blob/master/myHDL_DigitalSignalandSystems/Phase%20Lock%20Loop/PhaseDetectorsAndFractionalFrequencyDividers.ipynb)

* Digital to Analog Converters 
  * 1 Bit Delta-Sigma Digital to Analog Converter (https://github.com/PyLCARS/PythonUberHDL/tree/master/myHDL_DigitalSignalandSystems/DigitalAnalog_AnalogDigital)
