## "Python over HDL"
Python Jupyter Notebooks and FPGA designs showcasing what myHDL can do over traditional Verilog or VHDL

Three Major usages of traditional HDL will be explored in a textbook style using Jupyter Notebooks and other learning materials to show how with
[myHDL](http://www.myhdl.org/), [myhdlpeek](https://github.com/xesscorp/myhdlpeek), and other Python libraries. Python can simplify the development and enhance the testing of HDL that was once only possible with Verilog and VHDL

The Three Main areas of HDL that will be explored are:
1. Elementry Digital Logic at the introductory Electrical Engineering Bachelors levels (not to say this can be pick up anyone willing to invest the time or effort); 
2. Digital Signal Processing 
3. Fundamental Computer (Embedded) System design

Accompanying YouTube Videos will be posted at (PyLCARS)
