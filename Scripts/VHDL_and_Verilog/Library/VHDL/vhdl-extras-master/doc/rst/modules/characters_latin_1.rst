Description
-----------

This package provides Latin-1 character constants. These constants are
adapted from the definitions in the Ada'95 ARM for the package
``Ada.Characters.Latin_1``.

This package differs from the Ada implementation in that constants are not
defined for the control characters to avoid ambiguity between the elements
of the VHDL character enumeration.
